Proposal
________________


- What problem does your app solve?  One source for dad jokes!
- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem? All the jokes you need in one spot. No more searching.
- What is the mission statement? To bring levity humor to web.  
Features
________________


- What features are required for your minimum viable product? A full CRUD app. With backend and marketing page.
- What features may you wish to put in a future release? An added audio section for tone. A what is hot page! 
- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users? The Dad joke apps have messaging and commenting for users. Along with some sick dad jokes.


Frameworks - Libraries
________________


- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using? Material Ui React 
- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access? I can haz dadjokes.com for our public users and our own Api for our logged in users
- Are you required to pay to use the API? No
- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?) No
For Data Scientists
________________




- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1.  N/A
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have. N/A
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app


Target Audience
________________


- Who is your target audience? Be specific. Any one that is cool duh??
- What feedback have you gotten from potential users? No user testing yet. 
- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
No not yet working on it.


Research
________________


- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)
________________


- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
